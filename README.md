Human was first recorded in the mid 13th century, and owes its existence to the Middle French humain “of or belonging to man.” That word, in turn, comes from the Latin humanus, thought to be a hybrid relative of homo, meaning “man,” and humus, meaning “earth.”

The first war in recorded history took place in Mesopotamia in c. 2700 BCE between Sumer and Elam.
